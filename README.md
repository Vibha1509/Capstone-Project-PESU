# CPU Scheduling Using Neural Networks

Developed an innovative CPU scheduling algorithm that combines the best features of traditional algorithms (SJC, FCFS, Round Robin) for optimized resource allocation. Used Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to process burst time, arrival time, and priority, enhancing efficiency in multitasking environments. Leveraged advanced machine learning and Python to create an adaptive solution. Published in a Scopus Indexed Springer Conference, showcasing the integration of machine learning in operating systems. <br>
